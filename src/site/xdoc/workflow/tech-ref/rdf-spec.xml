		<section name="RDF specification">
			<p>
				The
				<strong>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</strong>
				is
				<em>a language for representing
					information
				</em>
				about resources in the World Wide Web.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to W3C specification a
				<strong>Resource</strong>
				is everything that can be accessed via a
				<em>URIreference</em>
				, such as pages, things, people and so on
				.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each resource can be
				<em>described in terms of a set of multi-valued properties</em>
				, whose value can be:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>another Resource (obviously identified by an URIreference)</li>
				<li>
					a
					<strong>Literal</strong>
					, which is a "-delimited String representing a concrete
					value (such
					as a number or a message and so on) but not a resource
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Consequently an RDF statement is represented as a set of RDF
				Triples, composed by:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A
					<strong>subject</strong>
					identified by an URIreference
				</li>
				<li>
					A
					<strong>predicate</strong>
					(or property) identified by an URIreference
				</li>
				<li>
					An
					<strong>object</strong>
					which is the value of the property, so a Literal or an URIref to a
					Resource
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Given its structure, as previously stated, an RDF model can be
				represented as a Graph, in which arcs are properties and nodes are
				Resources or Literal, providing a graphical format.
				Generally this
				representation is only used for little models and
				surely not for
				exchange purposes; other textual alternatives are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>RDF/XML</strong>
					: the normative format for RDF models exchange
					(machine-processable)
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Terse RDF Triple Language (Turtle)</strong>
					: compact and human friendly format
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>N-Triples</strong>
					: easy to parse format useful for streaming serialization
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Details about these formats has been reported in the following. In
				order to provide comparison terms between each representation here
				is provided an informal description of an RDF model to be stated:
			</p>
			<source>
There is a resource (a webpage) "index.html" created on August, 16 1999 by a 
developer named Bob Smith. This page is written in english.</source>

			<subsection name="RDF/XML format">
				<p>
					As stated by its name, RDF/XML exploits the XML language to
					represent RDF statements.
				</p>
				<p>
					This choice make the format really handy for a machine and that's
					why it has been chosen as normative language for RDF exchange.
					Despite this, a document of this type cannot be correctly
					interpreted if it is partial, because some information could be
					missing; in fact statements have not to be ordered and generally
					cannot be ordered (e.g. A knows B and B knows A). In conclusion
					this format doesn't fit streaming serialization cases, as a
					counterpart N-Triples format fits better.
				</p>
				<p>
					RDF/XML syntax is reported in the following (w.r.t the presented example).

 <strong>&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</strong>
				</source>

				<p>
					Looking at this listing we can infer some information:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <em>root</em> of an RDF/XML is the <tt>&lt;rdf:RDF&gt;</tt> tag, with namespaces declarations
						<ul>
							<li>Namespace are used to import external vocabularies</li>
							<li><em>A vocabulary is an RDF model, expressed in 
								<a href="rdfs-spec.html">RDFSchema</a>, which defines a set of 
								classes and properties</em></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Inside the root some <tt>&lt;rdf:Description&gt;</tt> tags are list (order doesn't matter)
					<ul>
						<li>Each description is about a resource, specified in the 
							<tt>rdf:about</tt> attribute via its URIreference</li>
						<li>A description is defined by a set of properties, contained in it
						<ul>
							<li>Each properties is defined by a tag named as the property itself</li>
							<li>If the property should point to a resource than its URIreference 
								should be specified in the <tt>rdf:resource</tt> attribute</li>
							<li>If the property expects a literal then the value is written inside property's tags.
							<ul>
								<li>Given the fact that literals are String representations of a value, 
								it is possible to specify the <em>language tag</em> and/or the <em>datatype tag</em>:
								the former specifies the language in which the String is written, the latter specifies
								the original value datatype</li>
							</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The statements, that has been highlighted in the previous listing, reflect what has just been said.
				</p>
				<h4>Reducing Verbosity: The typed node abbreviation</h4>
				<p>
					This description is really verbose and as the model grows even the number of tags grows too. 
					A first method to reduce the dimension of the produced document is defining the properties, 
					which are relative to the same resource in the same description. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover if resources to be described has a <tt>rdf:type</tt> (see <a href="rdfs-spec.html">RDFSchema specification</a>)
					statement then it is possible to replace the <tt>&lt;rdf:Description&gt;</tt> tag with a specific tag 
					reporting the name of the relative <tt>rdf:Class</tt>. This method is similar to the one used to 
					define properties.
				</p>
				<p> 
					An example is reported in the following listing:

   &lt;/exterms:Developer&gt;

 &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
				</source>
				<p>
					Obviously <tt>exterms:WebPage</tt> and <tt>exterms:Developer</tt> should be two classes 
					defined somewhere referred by the <tt>exterms</tt> namespace declaration.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Turtle format">
				<p>
					This is the most human-readable format, in fact it provides a compact representation of each resource
					with all its properties reported below it. 
					Despite its structural similarities with RDF/XML (see last RDF/XML example) the absence of tags, 
					which has been substituted with indentation, punctuation and brackets, let the focus be maintained on information.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The shared example, formatted in Turtle, looks like in the following (N.B.: a line which starts with "#" is a comment).

				<p>
					Obviously, in order to declare the type of a class, the <tt>rdf:type</tt> property can be specified.
					Generally in this case type declaration is stated as first and written in the same line of the resource's URIref.
					A typical shorthand adopted in Turtle is using "a" in place of "rdf:type", as shown in the following listing:

			<subsection name="N-Triples format">
				<p>
					This is the simplest format. It consist in listing all RDF triples that compose the model.
					This feature make it convenient when a model needs to be streamed over the network, 
					in fact each line represent a complete statement.  
				</p>
				<p>
					As usual, the example, in N-Triples (also called N3) format, is reported in the following; 
					for the sake of brevity only information about the developer has been listed.

				<p>
					In order to distinguish an URIref from a Literal the former is enclosed in angle brakets, the latter in double quotes; this notation equals the one used in Turtle. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In this notation no prefix can be declared, so they has not been used because meaningless for a machine. 
					Sometimes this rule is overcome to obtain a human-readable format, such as while debugging, but it's not a common practice because the reader should know in advance
					prefix-URIref mapping (otherwise information are useless). 
				</p>
			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section name="About URIreferences and Literals">
			<p>
				Let's now going deeply in the definition of these two essential elements.
			</p>
			<subsection name="URIreferences (a.k.a URIrefs)">
				<p>
					RDF uses URI references to name subjects, predicates, and objects in RDF statements. 
					A <strong>URI reference (or URIref) is a URI, together with an optional fragment identifier at the end.</strong>
				</p><p>
					For example, the URI reference <tt>http://www.example.org/index.html#Section2</tt> consists of the URI 
					<tt>http://www.example.org/index.html</tt> and (separated by the "#" character) the fragment identifier Section2. 
					RDF URIrefs can contain Unicode characters, allowing many languages to be reflected in URIrefs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to obtain a human-readable URIreference a <em>namespace</em> can be declared. This way the URI part of an URIref
					can be mapped in a <em>prefix</em> (also called QName, from XML), obtaining something like <tt>&lt;prefix&gt;:&lt;fragment-id&gt;</tt>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					[To be verified] In order to obtain WWW compatibility the number sign ("#"), used as URIref's components separator, can be substituted by a slash ("/"). 
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Literals">
				<p>
				<strong>Literals are used to identify values such as numbers and dates by means of a lexical representation.</strong> 
				Anything represented by a literal could also be represented by a URI, but it is often more convenient or intuitive to use literals.
				</p>
				<p>
					A literal may be the object of an RDF statement, but not the subject or the predicate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Literals may be <em>plain</em> or <em>typed</em> :
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A plain literal is a string combined with an optional language tag. This may be used for plain text in a natural language. 
						As recommended in the RDF formal semantics, these plain literals are self-denoting.</li>
					<li>A typed literal is a string combined with a datatype URI. It denotes the member of the identified datatype's value space 
						obtained by applying the lexical-to-value mapping to the literal string.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					An example of a plain literal with language tag is <tt>"car"@en</tt> (only <tt>"car"</tt> if language tag is omitted), while
					a typed literal is something like <tt>"35"^^&lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer&gt;</tt> 
					(or <tt>xsd:integer</tt> if <tt>xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</tt> has been declared). 
				</p>
			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section name="Advanced features">
		<subsection name="Blank nodes">
		<p>
			A <strong>blank node</strong> is a resource whose URIreference has not been designated to be globally valid; 
			this feature is achieved omitting URIreference's namespace (generally, in Turtle, is indicated with an underscore).
		</p>
		<p>
			Blank nodes are used to represent <em>existential variables</em>, that are variables not binded to a specific resources, because they model an abstract concept.
			An example is the phrase: <em>"There's someone special out there for everyone."</em>: in order to express this information in RDF we cannot use specific resources
			because the concepts of <em>someone</em> and <em>everyone</em> are generic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another use case is when we want to state that a person has a residence at a particular address. In this example, if we use a global variable, we are forced to 
			identify a particular residence and, in case we have two models defining a globally valid residence, their merge would produce a double residence. On the other side,
			if we use a blank node, the residence, which is only a mean to associate a residency to a person, has only local meaning and the model is correct.     
		</p>
		<p>
			Examples of how to use blank nodes are also reported in the subsection about Reification and RDF Containers (see RDF List example). 
			Here we report only the shorthand provided by Turtle to obtain a compact formalization (w.r.t to the residency example).

	sw:isInCity "Arlington" ;
	sw:isInState “VA”
	] .</source>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Reification">
		<p>
			The <strong>Reification</strong> process consist in <em>stating something about another RDF statement</em>.
			This is an extremely valuable tool for practical Semantic Web systems. It can be employed to qualify or annotate information in useful ways.
			One application might be to tag information with provenance information or with a timestamp of when it was added to a system.

		As usual an example is reported in the following.

:Matt :asserts _:stmt .

_:stms a rdf:Statement ;
	rdf:subject :John ;
	rdf:predicate foaf:knows ;
	rdf:object :Ryan .</source>
		<p>
		In this RDF model we stated that "Matt says that John knows Ryan". A <strong>RDF Statement</strong> is a resource which always has three properties: a <tt>rdf:subject</tt>,
		a <tt>rdf:predicate</tt> and a <tt>rdf:object</tt>.
		</p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="RDF Containers">
		<p>
			RDF defines <em>three types of resources</em> that are understood to be collections of resources:  
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><tt><strong>rdf:Bag</strong></tt> is used to represent an unordered grouping of resources</li>
			<li><tt><strong>rdf:Seq</strong></tt> is used to represent an ordered one</li>
			<li><tt><strong>rdf:Alt</strong></tt> a <tt>rdf:Bag</tt> whose elements represents equivalent alternatives</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In order to fill the container there are two available options: <em>(1)</em> state a relation from the container 
			to the contained resource whose predicate is <tt>rdf:_n</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is the resource position, or 
			<em>(2)</em> state a simpler relation whose predicate is <tt>rdf:li</tt>; 
			in the latter case the ordering determines the actual position.
		</p>
		<p>In the following an example, in Turtle notation, is reported</p>
		<source>
@prefix ex: &lt;http://www.example.org/&gt; .
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf.syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix people: &lt;http://www.semanticwebprogramming.net/people&gt; .

ex:Authors a rdf:Bag
	rdf:_1 people:Ryan		# or rdf:li
	rdf:_2 people:Matt		# or rdf:li
	rdf:_3 people:Andrew	# or rdf:li
	rdf:_4 people:John		# or rdf:li

ex:Book ex:writtenBy ex:Authors</source>
		<p>
			Unfortunately if we have two models that refers to a homonymous bag like the <tt>ex:Authors</tt> one, 
			the result of a merge will be a single bag containing all the authors. To solve this problem ,in the case this actually is a problem,
			an <tt><strong>rdf:List</strong></tt> can be used, in fact this class represents a sealed list, defined recursively (see the following listing, in Turtle).

		This can be a valuable tool, but it is an extremely awkward and unreadable way to represent RDF lists. 
		Thankfully, Turtle provides very concise shorthand to represent RDF lists; previous example can then be reviewed as follows.
