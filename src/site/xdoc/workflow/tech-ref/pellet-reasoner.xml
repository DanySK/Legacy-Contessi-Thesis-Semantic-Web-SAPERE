			<p>
				Pellet is an OWL 2 reasoner. For applications that need to
				represent and reason about information using OWL, Pellet is the
				leading choice for systems where sound-and-complete OWL DL reasoning
				is essential. Pellet includes support for OWL 2 profiles including
				OWL 2 EL. It incorporates optimizations for nominals, conjunctive
				query answering, and incremental reasoning.
