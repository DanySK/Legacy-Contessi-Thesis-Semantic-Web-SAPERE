			<p>
				The aim of this document is collecting information about the
				actual
				version of SAPEREnode, developed by Michele Desanti (see his
				<a href="http://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/Theses/LSAspace">thesis page</a>
				) and Michele Morgagni (see his
				<a href="http://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/Theses/SapereComm">thesis page</a>
				).
			</p>
			<p>
				All information presented in this section will be used as a
				starting point for this thesis work.

			<subsection name="The Node">
				<p>
					A SAPERE node, according to the resulting implementation, is
					composed by:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						a
						<strong>Space</strong>
						which provides a mean of serialization for local LSAs (see
						<em>The space</em>
						subsection)
					</li>
					<li>
						a
						<strong>Reaction Manager</strong>
						which is an entity responsible of handling and scheduling
						operations (on the space) that affect the current state of the
						node (see
						<em>The Reaction Manager</em>
						subsection)
					</li>
					<li>
						a
						<strong>Notifier</strong>
						which alerts subscribers of relevant events
					</li>
					<li>
						a set of
						<strong>Agents</strong>
						and
						<strong>Managers</strong>
						which handles networking and interactions with other nodes and
						entities outside the system
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<tt>Space</tt>
					and
					<tt>ReactionManager</tt>
					are the most important components of this architecture because
					they're involved in
					<em>system status management</em>
					. Considering that this project needs to act on this component they
					will be
					presented deeply in the following.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="The Space">
				<p>
					The space is defined as an entity capable of:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Having a name</li>
					<li>
						Providing agents primitives:
						<tt>inject</tt>
						,
						<tt>remove</tt>
						,
						<tt>update</tt>
						,
						<tt>read</tt>
						(no observation primitive)
					</li>
					<li>Providing support to transactions</li>
					<li>Providing fresh LSA ids</li>
					<li>Providing a way to retrieve all LSAs or all LSA ids</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					An LSA is defined as the composition of an ID and a Content
					(a.k.a.
					Semantic Description). A Semantic Description is a set of
					Properties,
					each one defined by a name and a set of values: if
					number sign ("
					<tt>#</tt>
					") is prefixed to the name the property is called a
					<em>synthetic property</em>, which is a read-only property that only the middleware can update;
					no other constraint has been set.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="The Reaction Manager">
				<p>
					In this implementation the reaction manager is the entity
					responsible for interaction with the space and
					scheduling of
					reactions.
				</p>
				<p>
					After its creation some ecolaws can be added. Moreover only
					<tt>queueOperation</tt>
					or
					<tt>queueTransaction</tt>
					can be called in order
					to inform the manager of the intention to
					execute some sort of operation(s). Operations requested by the user
					or by the execution of an ecolaw are scheduled
					according to local
					time. An ecolaw is fired exploiting the
					<tt>ReagentManager</tt>
					: for each ecolaw a score is computed in order to determine if its
					reactants
					exist; in this case a transaction (which will update the
					LSA-space) is scheduled for the next rate occurrence.
