Bundle-Description: This project provides an alternative implementatio
 n of LSA-space which provides native support to ACID transactions.jen
 a-tdb (component on which this implementation is based) is meant to b
 e an high-performance solution and that's why it's memory fingerprint
  is big (documentation declares a Java Heap Space requirement of 1GB)
 .This solution could be problematic on pervasive systems.
